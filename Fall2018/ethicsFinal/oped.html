<!--    Benjamin B. Burge       10/7 (late!)        Design for Journalist
Here's an article layout with multible CSS stylesheets!
Each has a desktop, tablet, and mobile version. Having always before started with a desktop view I designed these with mobile in mind starting out. The full screen layouts ended up pretty different looking! This is a great way to wrap ones head around how powerful CSS can be.

            <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/37707240/The-Role-of-Print-in-the-Rise-of-Democracy" target="_blank"><p class="articleQuote">“Democracy – at least as a concept – grew rapidly in popularity,” out of the “the Age of Revolution” and “the Age of Capital.” There was a “rise in the sophistication and spread of the print medium, particularly in the form of the daily newspaper.”</p></a>
        	<p class="article">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rise of print media influenced, or was influenced by an increase in the popularity of Democratic ideas; they grew together, defining the spaces where news was consumed.  Coffee-houses acted early on as little more than distributors, selling French newspapers in the early 1700s, but as the century progressed it became increasing common to see readers taking up debates, synthesizing stories with other’s experiences, often over tea or ale.  Readership eagerly accepted new publications, and inventions like the double press or linotype machine made publishing mass quantities much easier.</p>
            <p class="article">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was in this time the Citizen was born.  Concepts like “public opinion” formed from folks gathered around issues, discussing their ideas and relations to the works.  Readers were subject to a multitude of perspective.  Ambushed by ideas, confronted by topics they never yet conceived.  Publications were a tool for individuals to connect with each other. Organizing and opening minds.</p>
            <p class="article">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Today’s media landscape does not promote a space where people can connect. <a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/life/generation-social-isolation/1069493" target="_blank">Though technology gets the blunt of the blame,</a>, media is there at the forefront too.  Further isolating the stories we tell: The guise of objectivity.  It has demolished any sense of voice in articles, blurring the outlets into one news voice.  The senseless landscape of facts simplifies, and often falls short of Truth.  The use of objectivity has hurt the ability for readers to connect to the text they are reading.</p>
            <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/44740700/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/why-do-news-anchors-all-talk-same/" target="_blank"><p class="articleQuote">“The main quality of "the voice" is that it must contain no traces of regionalism, said Amy Caples, a former news anchor who teaches voice classes in the broadcasting program at Temple University in Philadelphia.”</p></a>
            <p class="article">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;News voice obfuscates the reporter.  You know the voice.  <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/20/18104413/amazon-alexa-speaking-style-machine-learning-neural-ntts-newscaster" target="_blank">We know the voice so well it can be programmed.</a>  Style guides have been developed to streamline facts-- but do they offer readers connection?  Some may make the argument that a standardized system insures clear delivery; something that readers have come to expect.  However, I’m not convinced the system always presents stories in the most clear manner.  Perhaps an effective method for listing facts, but the method proves dull, and closed off.  Reporters are trained to sound distant, often times we even forget they’re there.  This works fine for information dissemination, but it fails to provoke the public’s critical analysis of complex topics.  Facts alone offer little without someone to interpret, teach us, what they imply.</p>
            <p class="article">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is why talk radio works so well.  Text has no host.  The voice offers inflection.  There’s undeniably a person behind those words.  Phone banks take it to the public, and when we hear from an expert, we really hear from an expert.  There’s a warmth and welcome that’s not present with print media.</p>
            <a href="https://www.poynter.org/news/writing-top-down-pros-and-cons-inverted-pyramid" target="_blank"><p class="articleQuote">“Critics of the inverted pyramid say it's outdated, unnatural, boring, artless, and a factor in the declining readership that newspapers have been grappling with for decades.”</p></a>
            <p class="article">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Objective reporting has been bent into a hollow affect. Coined to promote clarity in sourcing, <a href="https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/journalism-essentials/bias-objectivity/lost-meaning-objectivity/" target="_blank">objective reporting strove to be transparent in its information gathering process.</a>  After all, our bias is strictly what we are blind too-- and though the use of news teams can help smooth the edges, there is an inherent problem in trying to remove your own point of view.  Objectivity was misunderstood and morphed into a line of facts, an inverted pyramid.  An approach that resents an individual’s interpretation, and so instead insists we derive no interpretation from the events covered. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/may/31/mass-media-is-over-but-where-does-journalism-go-from-here" target="_blank">This news product can be nonpartisan, and appeal to multiple demographic groups.</a>  It makes sense financially to run stories like this, but the model does not connect-- <a href="https://medium.com/whither-news/death-to-the-mass-eb33c08dc3b6" target="_blank">not to mention, it not sustainable.</a>  Stories are broken down to the most basic facts.  Alas, facts matter little without mention of what the facts mean.  Worse yet, we forget the initial goal of objectivity: to site and source clearly the information from which text is based on.</p>
            <p class="article">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hyper-focused on facts, we forget: facts are nouns, they are liable to transposition, misalignment.  How can facts alone accurately capture the events, on-going, they describe?  Context is build from history, which extends to our individual experiences.  Unless we can take into account how those part of the story feel, unless we can tell their story, it will be difficult to connect, empathize, and absorb the story, let alone report the Truth.  Statistic analysis is an amazing tools that allow experts to make better predictions, but the wrong hands can draw unruly conclusions.  Often misrepresented, or placed without context, <a href="https://www.newswise.com/articles/manipulated-mismanaged-misrepresented-statistics" target="_blank">bad statistics exemplify how a ‘fact’ can create confusion.</a>  The expectation of this sort of objective writing restricts some stories from being told effectively.</p>
            <p class="article">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It’s often expressed that letting the public draw their own conclusions eliminates bias.  If this method does prevent bias from a journalist, it does not prevent any bias the reader may bring.  When journalists tour with readers, new perspectives, stories grow.  Every new point of view in a story is another chance that a reader may see something differently.  Every new point of view a member of the coffee-house crowd, debating aside the newstand.</p>
            <p class="article">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/12/news-is-bad-rolf-dobelli" target="_blank">We cannot give up on news.</a>  Now more than ever, challenging, thoughtful, media will help tune the public.  We read the news, and struggle to dig past headlines.  Why is it so difficult to get through a piece of content?  It is news that is engaging, and entertaining, that is winning the eyeballs these days.  As print media continues to decline in sales, publications need to embrace the original ideals of objective reporting, freeing writers to use their own voice.  The quest bound to end subjectivity might end our connection to print journalism.</p>
