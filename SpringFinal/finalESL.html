		New York City — speaks in over 200 languages. Though it’s unlikely you’ll hear many of them in the classroom: there are only 14 languages supported in current English as a Second Language programs. That is not to put down the Division of English Language Learners and Students Support (DELLSS). Their work with the Department of Education provides ESL support beyond the scope of most municipalities.

		Recent data on the 2017-2018 school year suggests 545 unique programs supporting those 14 languages other than English (Shown above). Within the last four years DELLSS has created over 200 new programs, and plans to add 48 more next school year. The number of languages supported is also on the rise. Next year’s addition will create the first Albanian program.</p>

		Spanish is the predominant language provided with almost four times the support of all other languages combined. Second highest is Chinese with 70. Hebrew, Italian, Korean, Polish, japanese, and Urdu each have only a single program in the city. DL and TBE share the spread just shy of evenly.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		DELLSS has not only expanded programs, but they have retooled the types of program provided. Traditional ESL is no longer offered alone, rather it serves as support to two new services: Dual Language and Transitional Bilingual Education. This shift leans into a classroom environment where language is learned alongside course content.</p>
	<h3>Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE)</h3>
	<p>Instruction is offered in a native language as well as English. Used in tandem with ESL, this program follows students until they test proficient in the New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT). Schools must offer this service for an additional two years to students who tests proficient.</p>
	<h3>Dual Language (DL)</h3>
	<p>ELL and English speaking students are paired in the classroom where lessons are taught in two languages. The focus here is in bilingual classrooms. Here, 	students are not expected to exit DL instruction after English proficiency.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Depending on the needs of a school, the NYC DoE implements one of these two programs, each pertaining to a single non-english language. The charts below follow the take over of DL and TBE programs: the 2017-2018 school year marks to end of the transition.</p>

		Dual Language  programs were once a tiny fraction. Prior to the DoE’s half-decade push for ESL services, DL programs made up less than 5% of those taught in classrooms. The gap between TBE and DL will further close next semester according to last Thursday’s announcement from DoE Chancellor Richard A. Carranza. 48 new ESL programs will be initiated next Fall,32 of which will be DL. This expansion will also create language options in areas lacking present programs.</p>

		Depending on the needs of a school, the NYC DoE implements one of these two programs, each pertaining to a single non-english language. The chart above shows TBE programs as circles and DL as squares. Curious about the split? here’s another look at that ratio.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Dual Language  programs were once a minority. Prior to the DoE’s half-decade push for ESL services, DL programs made up less than 18% of those taught in classrooms. The gap between TBE and DL will further close next semester according to last Thursday’s announcement from DoE Chancellor Richard A. Carranza. <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/Offices/mediarelations/NewsandSpeeches/2017-2018/Chancellor+Richard+A+Carranza+Announces+Bilingual+Programs+Expansion+48+New+Programs+Opening+This+Fa.htm">48 new ESL programs will be initiated next Fall,</a> 32 of which will be DL. This expansion will also create language options in areas lacking present programs.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below the number of programs per district is isolated. I implore you to consider how this distribution has come to form.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    	Most ESL programs in this country are focused on assimilating students, teaching them English with very little regard for their native language, or what they speak at home. This isn’t the case in New York. Dual Language and Transitional Bilingual Education may eliminate most out-of-classroom language instruction, but it provides additional language support within core classes.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    	The DoE has made great strides towards an accessible and ubiquitous ESL experience. The growth not only opens access to ELLs, but promotes the benefits of a bilingual classroom. As programs expand to new areas of the city an even larger body of students will find their lessons taught in the languages conducive to their learning.
