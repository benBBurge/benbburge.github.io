        <h2>EFF Project ‘Apollo 1201’ Targets DRM: “Eradicate within a Decade!”</h2>
        <h4>Digital rights management software has stifled competition and restricted users while failing its goal to prevent piracy. The EFF hopes this project will finish off these cumbersome laws.</h4>
        <p>Determined to protect intellectual property, large-scale tech manufactures have relied on digital right management software (DRM) since 1998 to act as a digital lock. DRM blocks certain uses of hardware and software, often requiring internet connection, or preventing users from modifying and sharing copyrighted property. <a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow">Cory Doctorow</a>, author and co-editor of Boing Boing, joined with the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> to lead the Apollo 1201 mission back in 2015. Since the group has had varied success.</p>
        <p>Doctorow has been a long- time technical advocate, but few prior works of his can compare in scale to Apollo 1201. That’s where the EFF comes in. A nonprofit constructed to “defend civil liberties in the digital world,” they’ve been around since the ‘90s and work (often behind the scenes) to preserve an open and free web. Together Doctorow and the EFF have pursued multiple avenues to delegitimize and repeal DRM. It has been an uphill battle from the start, but Doctorow is confident history is on their side.</p>
