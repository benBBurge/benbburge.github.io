	        <p>Determined to protect intellectual property, large-scale tech manufactures have relied on digital right management software (DRM) since 1998 to act as a digital lock. DRM blocks certain uses of hardware and software, often requiring internet connection, or preventing users from modifying and sharing copyrighted property. <a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow">Cory Doctorow</a>, author and co-editor of Boing Boing, joined with the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> to lead the Apollo 1201 mission back in 2015. Since the group has had varied success.</p>
	        <p>Doctorow has been a long-time open web advocate, but few prior works of his can compare in scale to Apollo 1201. That’s where the EFF comes in. A nonprofit constructed to “defend civil liberties in the digital world,” they’ve been around since the ‘90s and work (often behind the scenes) to preserve an open and free web. Together Doctorow and the EFF have pursued multiple avenues to delegitimize DRM practice. It has been an uphill battle from the start, but Doctorow is confident history is on their side.</p>
	        <p>The Apollo 1201 project began working with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) to (initially repeal, then) reform a planned <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/encrypted-media/">Encrypted Media Extension</a> (EME) that lets vendors control where video content can be viewed. The EME standard was the first to remove power from the hosts, instead handing control to owners of the content. Protest against this standard comes from the fact DRM does a very poor job of doing what it says it does, more often allowing vendors to go after anyone using their services in a way they disagree with. Despite many W3C members supporting Apollo’s more moderate and secure modifications to the web standard, the final decision, made in September of this year, did not accommodate Apollo’s requests.</p>
	        <h3>“DRM isn't about protecting copyright. It is about using copyright to seize other rights, like the right to decide who could criticize your product -- or compete with it.”</h3>

	        <p>Another Apollo 1201 mission sought to persuade the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to consider creating rules for companies to label software using DRM measures. Doctorow had collected detailed testimony from 20 Americans documenting how users unknowingly purchased DRM locked goods and consequently could not use them as anticipated. Doctorow also argues there should be few complaints about labeling DRM software, since companies insist consumers prefer these products. The FTC has yet to make a decision.</p>

	        <h3>“For many years, EFF has fought the use of DRM technologies, explaining that such technologies—as well as the laws that support them—impede innovation, security, and basic user rights and expectations, while failing to inhibit copyright infringement.”</h3>
	        <p class="quoteCredit">Cory Doctorow’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/cory-doctorow-rejoins-eff-eradicate-drm-everywhere">press release after rejoining the EFF</a></p>
        	<p>One final public spoke of Apollo 1201 is a lawsuit filed by the EFF which claims the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is unconstitutional. The DMCA, which is often criticized for its broad interpretation, acted as a threat for those using hardware or software outside of what vendors consider ‘normal’ use. In the EFF’s case, they represent two clients: Andrew Huang, developer of NeTV, a system that can overlay images on top of DRM video signal, and Matthew Green, whose work deals with advanced cyber security. Both clients’ work should be legal, but under the DMCA they face, a minimum of five years in prison and a $500K fine.</p>
        	<h3>“Instead of welcoming vulnerability reports, companies routinely threaten good-faith security researchers with civil action, or even criminal prosecution. Companies use the courts to silence researchers who have embarrassing things to say about their products, or who uncover too many of those products’ internal details.”</h3>
        	<p class="quoteCredit">from <a href="https://boingboing.net/2016/07/21/eff-is-suing-the-us-government.html">Matthew Green’s statement on the case</a></p>
        	<p>Going on two years now, Apollo 1201 is strong as ever. Despite support from more than  20,000 EFF members, it is still an uphill battle. An uphill battle that may be hard to find. Searching “Apollo 1201” online will yield few results. While the EFF’s actions have seen publicity, outside of Doctorow’s writing, they are discussed individually, and never within the context of the Apollo project. When pressed on the issue of coverage, Doctorow said he is currently working with “three sets of documentarians” to “produce web, theatrical and TV materials on the issue.” An effort that will no doubt aid in public understanding and support destroying DRM.</p>
